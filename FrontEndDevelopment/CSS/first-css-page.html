      <h2>Foundations of Datascience & AI</h2>
    </li>
   
     <p id="para1">
       Data science focuses on exploiting the modern deluge of data for prediction, exploration, understanding, and intervention. It emphasizes the value and necessity of approximation and simplification; it values effective communication of the results of a data analysis and of the understanding about the world and data that we glean from it; it prioritizes an understanding of the optimization algorithms and transparently managing the inevitable tradeoff between accuracy and speed; it promotes domain-specific analyses, where data scientists and domain experts work together to balance appropriate assumptions with computationally efficient methods.” – David Blei and Padhraic Symth, “Science and Data Science,” Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, vol. 114, no. 33, June 2017, pp. 8689-8692.

      <h2>Advanced Application Programming Using Java</h2>
    </li>

    <p id="para2">
	  A continued exploration of the Java programming language with an emphasis in utilizing more advanced features of the language in software development. Topics include generics, multithreading, networking, JavaFX, databases, servlets, and <span class="sp2" title="Java Server Page">JSP</span>. This course is co-listed with CS 4120. Prerequisite(s): CS 2300. <span id="sp1"> An additional fee is associated with this course.</span> Applications built using Advanced Java programming are highly scalable without the need for recoding or developing from scratch. Advanced Java-based applications come equipped with load balancers that can automatically handle resource allocation and data processing without affecting performance.

    <li>
       <h2>Advanced Database Systems</h2>
    </li>
  
    <p id="para3">
	  This course is a comprehensive study of the internals of modern database management systems. It will cover the core concepts and fundamentals of the components that are used in both high-performance transaction processing systems (OLTP) and large-scale analytical systems (OLAP). The class will stress both efficiency and correctness of the implementation of these ideas. All class projects will be in the context of a real in-memory, multi-core database system. The course is appropriate for graduate students in software systems and for advanced undergraduates with dirty systems programming skills.
